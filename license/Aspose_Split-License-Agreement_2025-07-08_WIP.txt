2.  	GRANT OF LICENSE.  Aspose grants You the rights described in this Agreement provided that You comply with all the terms and conditions of this Agreement:

2.1.	Split License Grant.  Licensed Works are split licensed and may be licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 or an Aspose Commercial License. Licenses are granted based upon You meeting the qualified criteria as stated. Once granted, You must reference the granted license only in all documentation.

2.1.2	Split License Criteria.  Licensed Works are licensed to You under the Apache License, Version 2.0 if:
(i) You are consuming the Licensed Work in Non-Commercial Open Source Works, or 
(ii) You are consuming the Licensed Work as a Transitive Package Dependency, or 
(iii) You are consuming the Licensed Work as a Direct Package Dependency in the capacity of a Qualifying Business, or 
(iv) You are consuming the Licensed Work as a Direct Package Dependency in the capacity of a Non-Profit Entity and Your Larger Works are solely in support of the public-interest mission.

2.1.3.	Continued Qualification.  Your right to use the Licensed Work under the Apache License, Version 2.0 is conditional upon Your continued satisfaction of the applicable qualification criteria (e.g., as a Qualifying Business, Non-Profit Entity, or other stated exception).

If at any time You no longer meet the criteria to qualify for using the Apache License, Version 2.0 then Your rights under the Apache License are revoked, and You must obtain a valid Aspose Commercial License to continue using the Licensed Work.

Optional: Aspose reserves the right to request documentation or verification of qualification status for any entity using the Licensed Work under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

2.2.	Commercial License.  For all other scenarios, Licensed Works are licensed to You under the Aspose Commercial License which may be purchased by visiting https://aspose.org/pricing/.

3.  	RESTRICTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS.

3.1.	Restrictions

3.1.1.	You may not create, publish, or distribute any library, SDK, plugin, or framework that wraps, re-exports, or abstracts functionality of the Licensed Work for use by third parties.  For the avoidance of doubt, the creation of wrappers, bindings, or frameworks that expose the functionality of the Licensed Work to third parties constitutes creation of a derivative work and does not qualify as transitive use.

This restriction does not apply to internal use by a single legal entity, provided the wrapper is not distributed externally or made accessible as a public-facing API or component.

3.1.2.	The Licensed Work may not be used to develop Larger Works that offer similar or competing functionality as the Licensed Work.

3.1.3.	Larger Works may not copy, replicate, or substantially derive from the structure, organization, naming conventions, or method signatures of the Licensed Work’s public API, whether for public or private use.

3.2.	Requirements

3.2.1.	Any Larger Work incorporating or dependent upon the Licensed Work must clearly acknowledge the use of the License Work and its license terms in documentation, UI, or metadata, regardless of whether the Licensed Work is used directly or indirectly. If the Larger Work is server-side only, this requirement may be satisfied through API documentation or administrative console notices.
