[![Aspose.Cells FOSS for Python](https://products.aspose.org/media/cells/python/banner-readme.png)](https://products.aspose.org/cells/python/)

Aspose.Cells FOSS for Python is a free, open-source, pure-Python library for creating, reading,
and modifying Excel `.xlsx` workbooks without requiring Microsoft Excel. It runs on Python 3.7 or
later and depends only on `pycryptodome` (AES encryption) and `olefile` (Compound File Binary
handling). It covers cell values and formulas, styling, data validation, conditional formatting,
auto filters, charts, drawing shapes, tables, sparklines, comments, embedded pictures, password
protection, and CSV/JSON/Markdown export.

## Key Capabilities

- The primary entry point is `Workbook`, used to create Excel files or edit and modify existing
  `.xlsx` files; it manages multiple worksheets — `add_worksheet()`, `remove_worksheet()`,
  `copy_worksheet()`, `get_active_worksheet()`, and `Worksheet.rename()` cover creating,
  removing, and renaming them. Each worksheet exposes a `cells` collection of `Cell` objects for
  reading and writing values and formulas, plus a basic `FormulaEvaluator` for cells without
  cached values.
- `Style` (via `Cell.get_style()`/`apply_style()`) carries fonts, fills, borders, alignment, text
  wrap/rotation, and number formats, including built-in Excel number-format codes.
- `PageSetup`, `PageMargins`, and horizontal/vertical page-break collections configure print
  layout, and `Pane` configures freeze/split panes.
- Merged cells (`Cells.merge()`/`merge_range()`), defined names (`DefinedNameCollection`), and
  hyperlinks (`Hyperlinks`) to URLs, email addresses, files, and internal references round-trip
  through load and save.
- `DataValidationCollection` applies data validation rules (dropdown lists, number ranges, custom
  formulas), and `ConditionalFormatCollection` applies rules-based formatting, both scoped to
  cell ranges.
- Filtering a worksheet range down to matching rows is handled by `AutoFilter`.
- `ChartCollection` creates and modifies all 16 real `ChartType` values (line, bar, pie, area,
  box-and-whisker, waterfall, combo, scatter, stock, surface, radar, treemap, sunburst,
  histogram, funnel, and map), each with its own dedicated XML writer.
- Rectangles, ovals, textboxes, arrows, and other preset shapes (`MsoDrawingType`) are added via
  `ShapeCollection`, while `TableCollection` creates, styles, and manages structured Excel tables
  (ECMA-376's ListObject) with auto-filters.
- `SparklineGroupCollection` manages sparklines — a data-source range paired with the cell where
  each one appears, grouped by shared visual style.
- Cell comments with author and rich text are added via `Cell.set_comment()`, and
  `PictureCollection` embeds images anchored to a cell range.
- Password-protecting a workbook AES-encrypts it (`XLSXEncryptor`, Agile encryption per ECMA-376
  Part 2 §4) via `Workbook.save(password=...)`, and `Workbook(path, password=...)` decrypts one on
  load; `WorkbookProtection`/`SheetProtection` lock workbook structure and individual sheets
  independently of encryption.
- `Workbook.save_as_csv()`/`load_csv()`, `save_as_json()`, and `save_as_markdown()` export/import
  workbook data in CSV, JSON, and Markdown text formats alongside native `.xlsx` I/O.

## Installation

```bash
pip install aspose-cells-foss
```

Requires Python 3.7 or later. Installs `pycryptodome` (>=3.15.0) and `olefile` (>=0.46) as
dependencies.

## Quick Start

Create a new workbook and save it:

```python
from aspose.cells_foss import Workbook

workbook = Workbook()
worksheet = workbook.worksheets[0]

worksheet.cells["A1"].value = "Hello"
worksheet.cells["B1"].value = "World"
worksheet.cells["A2"].value = 42
worksheet.cells["B2"].value = 3.14

workbook.save("output.xlsx")
```

Read an existing workbook:

```python
from aspose.cells_foss import Workbook

workbook = Workbook("input.xlsx")
worksheet = workbook.worksheets[0]

value = worksheet.cells["A1"].value
print(f"Cell A1 contains: {value}")
```

## Additional Examples

Apply cell styling:

```python
from aspose.cells_foss import Workbook

workbook = Workbook()
worksheet = workbook.worksheets[0]
cell = worksheet.cells["A1"]

cell.value = "Styled Text"

style = cell.get_style()
style.font.bold = True
style.font.color = "#FF0000"
style.font.size = 14
cell.apply_style(style)

workbook.save("styled.xlsx")
```

### Add Data Validation (Dropdown List)

```python
from aspose.cells_foss import Workbook, DataValidationType

workbook = Workbook()
worksheet = workbook.worksheets[0]

validation = worksheet.data_validations.add("A1:A10")
validation.type = DataValidationType.LIST
validation.formula1 = '"Option1,Option2,Option3"'

workbook.save("validation.xlsx")
```

### Export to CSV

```python
from aspose.cells_foss import Workbook

workbook = Workbook("input.xlsx")
workbook.save_as_csv("output.csv")
```

### Password-Protect a Workbook

```python
from aspose.cells_foss import Workbook

workbook = Workbook()
worksheet = workbook.worksheets[0]
worksheet.cells["A1"].value = "Confidential Data"

workbook.save("protected.xlsx", password="mypassword")

workbook2 = Workbook("protected.xlsx", password="mypassword")
```

## Scope and Limitations

- Only `.xlsx` is supported for native load/save; CSV, JSON, and Markdown are additional
  text-format export targets (CSV also supports import), not general spreadsheet formats.
- Only Agile encryption (ECMA-376 Part 2, Section 4) is supported for reading and writing
  password-protected workbooks; Standard encryption (Section 3) is not yet supported for reading.
- `FormulaEvaluator` is a basic evaluator for cells without cached values — this is not a full
  spreadsheet calculation engine.

These limitations don't apply to
[Aspose.Cells for Python — Enterprise Edition](https://products.aspose.com/cells/python-java/),
which adds a full formula calculation engine, Standard encryption support, additional
spreadsheet formats, and dedicated enterprise support.
